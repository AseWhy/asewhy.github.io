# Briefly about me
Welcome to my site! My name is **Plekhanov** **Aleksey**, by father **Mikhailovich**). I have `{{ Math.floor((new Date()-new Date("2002/06/21"))/31557600000) }}` years, year, xs, this counts from my date of birth. At the moment, I graduated from studying at the SPO with a degree in `technician-programmer`. I am fond of programming, during my life I have tried many different frameworks, libraries and engines. I tried to write games, to be honest, it didn’t work out very well. At the moment, I settled on `web` development, and have been doing it for the last 2 years (or maybe not two))). The person is not conflict, and although I look like I'll throw the skates away tomorrow, I'm quite cheerful)

### What I can do
* I know how to use Google questions, not to ask stupid attempts)
* I understand the relational model of building a database.
* I understand someone else's code, I can work with someone else's code even without special comments, but I myself try to carefully comment on everything.
* I understand the principles of building `REST API`.
* I can work with docker/compos, git, at a level sufficient for team development.
* Understand client-server architecture.
* I can integrate **API** services (if they have documentation, at least some kind of documentation).
* If there was no skill you needed above, then it doesn’t matter, I learn quite quickly, at least at the time of writing this page.
